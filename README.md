Mockups of App screens for Coundown Project
These mockup screens were created with NetBeans, the best GUI editor/development tool available. Generated forms look and feel like application screens, without all the idiotic overhead of pure paint-or-draw tools like GIMP or Photoshop. Layouts are fast and easy, resources are managed sanly, etc.
PLUS, with a little code, they can be made interactive. WIN!
